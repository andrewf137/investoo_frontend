Installation of investoo_frontend2:
----------------------------------
Requirements:
1.- Install foundation-cli:
>npm install -g foundation-cli
2.- Download from github
3.- Run "npm install"
4.- Run "foundation watch"
5.- Folders structure:
    All scss code appart from foundation is in src/scs/components/_custom_component.scss

Custom use of foundation scss and javascript:
--------------------------------------------
(Source: https://zendev.com/2017/09/05/front-end-development-kickstarter-zurb-template.html)
1.- First we look at config.yml where some basic configuration is set.
    The config.yml file is where the build systems keep a set of static configuration data, things that will be used in our gulpfile to build our project, but that aren’t themselves code.
    The items configured here are:
    PORT: which is the port used for your development server.
    COMPATIBILITY: which gets passed right through to autoprefixer to determine what browsers to target when compiling our css.
    UNCSS_OPTIONS: which are used if you enable uncss in the gulpfile to unused css as a part of the build(disabled by default)
    PATHS: contains a set of paths used by the build.
        dist: to know where to put final files
        assets: to know where to find assets to copy
        sass: to know what additional directories to make available to our sass compilation
        entries: to know what entrypoint to start our JavaScript from
2.- gulpfile.babel.js is where all the magic occurs.

Troubleshooting:
---------------
1.- After runing this command:
        >foundation watch
    the following error arises in command console:
        [19:34:23] 'sass' errored after 8.05 s
        [19:34:23] Error: Node Sass does not yet support your current environment: Windows 64-bit with Unsupported runtime (57)
    Solution:
        Run this command:
        >npm rebuild node-sass
    Then run "foundation watch" command again.

2.- When running the command
        >foundation new
    the following error arises in the commnad console:
        Can't find Python executable "python", you can set the PYT HON env variable.
    Solution:
        Install python for windows (64 bits in my case).
        Then run:
        >npm install
        >foundation new
        Everything will work ok.
